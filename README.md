My goal with this program was for me to look at previous recessions and compare it to the current stock market to make good investment choices. I have been looking into investing in the stock market and thought it would be a good idea to create a program that lets me analyze the data in an easier way.

This program is to view specific stocks over specific time periods to make good investment choices. The way the program works is that you input a stock name and then you will be asked if you want to see data from a given period. If you say yes, you will be allowed to input a start date and an end date. Then the console will print the data and some basic information about the inputted stock.

The next step in this project is to plot the data and understand it in a better way.
